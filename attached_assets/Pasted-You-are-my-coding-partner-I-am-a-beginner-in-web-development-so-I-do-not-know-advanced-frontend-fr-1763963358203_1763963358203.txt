You are my coding partner. I am a beginner in web development, so I do not know advanced frontend frameworks like React, Next.js or TypeScript. Build everything using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. For backend, use Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB (Mongoose).

Goal: Create a full E-Commerce Web Application using my brand:
Brand Name: THE RAS
Color Theme:
- Primary Purple: #9333EA
- Secondary Pink: #F43F5E
- Accent Yellow: #FACC15
- Background White: #FFFFFF
- Text Dark Gray: #1F2937

Important:
- I want clean and beginner friendly code
- Add comments inside code explaining each part
- Always create files with proper structure and organization
- If I ask for new features, update code step-by-step instead of rewriting everything

Pages to Create:
1️⃣ Home Page
   - Header (Logo THE RAS, Search bar, Cart icon, Login button)
   - Hero Banner (with Shop Now button)
   - Shop by Category section (4-6 category cards)
   - Featured Products section (4–8 cards showing title & price)
   - Footer (contact links)

2️⃣ Product Listing Page
   - Grid view of products
   - Filtering by category (if possible)

3️⃣ Product Detail Page
   - Product image, title, price, description, category, and Add to Cart button

4️⃣ Cart Page
   - List of added items with total price and Remove button

5️⃣ Login & Signup Page (User Authentication)
   - Use MongoDB to store user data
   - Encrypt passwords using bcrypt
   - Use JWT for session tokens

6️⃣ Checkout Page
   - Address form
   - Only Cash on Delivery option for now

Admin Panel Features:
- Add Product (Title, Price, Category, Stock, Image URL)
- Edit/Delete Product

Database Requirements:
- Use MongoDB with Mongoose
- Product model must include: title, description, price, category, stock, image
- User model must include: name, email, password (hashed), role (admin/user)

Server Requirements:
- Use Express.js APIs following REST standards
- Include proper error handling in all endpoints
- CORS enabled for frontend communication

Client Requirements:
- Simple HTML pages that fetch data using JavaScript (fetch API)
- No frameworks like React, Angular, Vue

Performance & UI Requirements:
- Mobile responsive basic layout
- Buttons and cards matching brand colors
- Show loading states when fetching data

Each time we work:
- Ask me what feature I want next
- Confirm the plan before coding
- Explain everything in simple language

If anything is unclear, you must ask me questions instead of assuming.
